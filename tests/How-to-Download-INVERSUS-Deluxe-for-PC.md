## What is INVERSUS Deluxe?
 
INVERSUS Deluxe is an enhanced version of the original INVERSUS game that was released in 2016. The game is developed by Hypersect, an independent studio led by Ryan Juckett, a former programmer at Bungie. The game is inspired by classic arcade games such as Pac-Man, Asteroids, and Geometry Wars. The game has a minimalist aesthetic that uses only two colors: black and white. The game's core mechanic is that you can only move on the opposite color of your tile, and you can flip the color of the tiles by shooting them. This creates a dynamic and strategic gameplay that requires you to constantly adapt to the changing environment and your enemies' movements.
 
The game has four modes: Arcade, Versus, Co-Op, and Level Editor. Arcade mode is a single-player mode that challenges you to complete 50 maps with different objectives, such as surviving waves of enemies, collecting coins, or reaching the exit. Versus mode is a multiplayer mode that pits you against up to three other players in online or local matches. You can choose from various game modes such as Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, or King of the Hill. Co-Op mode is a multiplayer mode that lets you team up with up to three other players in online or local matches. You can work together to complete the Arcade mode maps or create your own custom maps using the Level Editor. Level Editor mode is a mode that lets you design your own maps using various tools and options. You can share your maps online or play them with your friends.
